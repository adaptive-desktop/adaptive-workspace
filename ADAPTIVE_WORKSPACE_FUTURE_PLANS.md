# Adaptive Workspace Future Plans

This document outlines future enhancements and considerations for the adaptive workspace viewport API beyond the initial implementation.

## Validation and Error Handling

### Operation Validation
- Add validation to prevent invalid operations (e.g., splitting a minimized viewport, operating on non-existent viewports)
- Implement bounds checking for split ratios (0 < ratio < 1)
- Define behavior for edge cases like splitting very small viewports
- Add error return types or exceptions for failed operations

### State Constraints
- Prevent conflicting states (e.g., viewport cannot be both minimized and maximized)
- Validate viewport operations based on current state
- Add pre-condition checks for all viewport operations

## Viewport Size Constraints

### Minimum Size Handling
- Define minimum viewport dimensions (both percentage and pixel-based)
- Consider device-specific constraints:
  - Phone portrait: optimal 1 viewport wide, max 2
  - Phone landscape: up to 4 viewports wide
  - Tablet/laptop landscape: up to 6 viewports wide
  - Ultra-wide monitors (21:9): dozen or more viewports
- Implement responsive minimum sizes based on screen dimensions
- Handle split operations that would violate minimum size constraints

### Adaptive Sizing Strategy
- Research optimal viewport sizing algorithms
- Consider user preferences and usage patterns
- Implement smart defaults based on device type and orientation

## Focus and Z-Index Management

### Viewport Focus System
- Implement focus management for maximized viewports
- Add z-index handling for overlapping scenarios
- Define focus behavior during viewport operations (split, minimize, restore)
- Add keyboard navigation between viewports

### Event System Enhancements
- Add events for operation failures and constraint violations
- Implement focus change events
- Add viewport lifecycle events (created, destroyed, state changed)

## Advanced Operations

### Group Operations
- "Close others" functionality
- Split n-ways operations
- Bulk viewport operations
- Viewport grouping and tabbing

### Undo/Redo System
- Implement operation history stack
- Add undo/redo for viewport operations
- Consider snapshot-based vs operation-based undo

### Workspace Persistence
- Serialize `isMinimized`/`isMaximized` states in workspace snapshots
- Save and restore viewport layouts
- User-defined workspace templates
- Auto-save workspace state

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Opportunities
- Lazy rendering for minimized viewports
- Efficient bounds calculation for complex layouts
- Debounced resize operations
- Memory management for large numbers of viewports

### Scalability
- Performance testing with many viewports
- Efficient data structures for viewport management
- Optimize change notification system for large workspaces

## User Experience Enhancements

### Accessibility
- Screen reader support for viewport operations
- Keyboard shortcuts for all operations
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion preferences

### Visual Feedback
- Animation system for viewport transitions
- Visual indicators for viewport states
- Drag and drop viewport management
- Preview modes for split operations

## Integration Features

### External System Integration
- Window manager integration on desktop platforms
- Native mobile gesture support
- Multi-monitor support
- Platform-specific optimizations

### Developer Experience
- Comprehensive testing utilities
- Debug mode with viewport visualization
- Performance monitoring tools
- Migration guides for API changes

## Research Areas

### Layout Algorithms
- Research optimal automatic layout algorithms
- Study user behavior patterns with multiple viewports
- Investigate AI-assisted layout suggestions
- Analyze accessibility requirements for complex layouts

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- Platform-specific UI guidelines compliance
- Performance characteristics across different devices
- Native integration opportunities
- Responsive design best practices
