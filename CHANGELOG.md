### Added

#### üèóÔ∏è Core Foundation
- **Feature 1: Core Data Structures** - Complete type system and LayoutTree class
  - `PanelId`, `LayoutDirection`, `LayoutBranch`, `LayoutPath` type definitions
  - `LayoutParent<T>` and `LayoutNode<T>` with full generic support
  - `LayoutTree<T>` class with immutable operations
  - Basic tree operations: `getRoot()`, `isEmpty()`, `copy()`, `equals()`

#### üîß Tree Utilities
- **Feature 2: Tree Utilities** - Essential tree manipulation functions
  - `isParent()` type guard with TypeScript narrowing
  - `getLeaves()` for extracting all panel IDs
  - `getNodeAtPath()` for tree navigation with path validation
  - `getOtherBranch()` and `getOtherDirection()` helper functions
  - `isValidSplitPercentage()` and `normalizeSplitPercentage()` utilities

#### ‚ö° Tree Operations
- **Feature 3: Tree Operations** - Advanced tree manipulation
  - `splitRegion(path, newPanelId, direction)` for creating new splits
  - `removeRegion(path)` for removing nodes and promoting siblings
  - `resizeRegion(path, percentage)` for updating split percentages
  - Private `replaceNodeAtPath()` helper for immutable updates
  - Full error handling with descriptive error messages

#### üß≠ Path Navigation
- **Feature 4: Path Navigation** - Advanced panel location and tree analysis
  - `findPanelPath(panelId)` for locating panels in the tree
  - `getAndAssertNodeAtPathExists(path)` for safe navigation
  - `createBalancedTreeFromLeaves(panels)` for generating balanced trees
  - `isValidPath()`, `getAllPaths()`, `getTreeDepth()` utilities
  - Extended LayoutTree methods: `getPanelIds()`, `hasPanel()`, `getDepth()`, etc.

#### üíæ Serialization
- **Feature 5: Serialization** - Complete JSON persistence support
  - `serializeLayoutTree()` and `deserializeLayoutTree()` with validation
  - `isValidSerializedTree()` for data validation
  - `cloneLayoutTree()` for deep cloning via serialization
  - Version-aware format with `SERIALIZATION_VERSION` constant
  - LayoutTree methods: `serialize()`, `deserialize()`, `clone()`, `toJSON()`, `fromJSON()`

#### üß™ Comprehensive Testing
- **236 total tests** across 5 test suites with **98.67% code coverage**
- Complete edge case coverage and error handling validation
- Support for both string and number panel IDs
- Round-trip serialization preservation testing

#### üì¶ Production Features
- **Framework Agnostic** - Zero runtime dependencies (only `tslib`)
- **TypeScript First** - 100% TypeScript with comprehensive generic support
- **Immutable Operations** - All tree modifications return new instances
- **Performance Optimized** - Efficient algorithms with structural sharing
- **Developer Experience** - Rich API with excellent IDE support and JSDoc documentation
