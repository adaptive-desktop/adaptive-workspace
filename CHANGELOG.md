### Added

#### üèóÔ∏è Viewport-Based Layout System

- **LayoutManager** - Core viewport management with CRUD operations
  - `createViewport()` - Create new viewports with proportional bounds
  - `splitViewport()` - Split existing viewports in all 4 directions (up/down/left/right)
  - `removeViewport()` - Remove viewports with proper cleanup
  - `findViewportById()` - Lookup viewports by ID with error handling
- **Workspace** - Public API with flexible ID/object parameter support
  - Accepts both viewport objects and string IDs for all operations
  - Automatic ID resolution with proper error handling
  - Clean separation between public API and internal implementation
- **MutableViewport** - Viewport implementation with bounds management
  - Proportional bounds (0.0-1.0) for layout calculations
  - Workspace bounds for coordinate transformations
  - Screen bounds for absolute positioning
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 124 tests passing across all components
  - Unit tests for LayoutManager operations
  - Integration tests for Workspace API
  - Edge case coverage and error handling validation

### Changed

- **Simplified Architecture** - Removed complex binary tree optimization
- **Direct Viewport Management** - Operations work directly on viewport collections
- **Standardized Direction Terminology** - All operations use 'up'|'down'|'left'|'right'

### Removed

- **Binary Tree Implementation** - Removed LayoutTree class and all tree operations
- **Tree Utilities** - Removed path-based navigation and tree manipulation functions
- **Complex Serialization** - Removed tree serialization and deserialization
- **Tree-Related Types** - Removed LayoutDirection, LayoutBranch, LayoutPath, LayoutParent, LayoutNode
- **Obsolete Documentation** - Removed 5 markdown files related to tree implementation

## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-04
