ViewportRequest

createViewportInternal(ViewportRequest viewport)

ViewportStateManager 
* takes ViewportRequest
* distributes to other contexts, updating the internal state
* returns the current ViewportState

ViewportManager takes ViewportState and updates the active viewports used by the renderer


viewportSnaphot is internal?
